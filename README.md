Time: PM 13:30 --- 14:30

#### Description

Generative adversarial network (GAN) has
recently emerged as a promising generative modeling approach.
It consists of a generative network and a discriminative
network. Through the competition between the two
networks, it learns to model the data distribution. In addition
to modeling the image/video distribution in computer vision
problems, the framework finds use in defining visual concept
using examples. To a large extent, it eliminates the need of
hand-crafting objective functions for various computer vision
problems. In this tutorial, we will present an
overview of generative adversarial network research. We will
cover several recent theoretical studies as well as training
techniques and will also cover several vision applications of
generative adversarial networks.
